Entire source code for the creation of https://lirik.tv/

This was a passion project i started for my favorite streamer. Sadly due to misunderstandings with the mod team i cancelled any and all development on this platform but allowed it to stay online for the community. Enjoy!

The Backend is not used in production and was just for development. Feel free to contact me if u wish to have smth like this made for your own Twitch channel
